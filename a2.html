        <h1>Football</h1>
        <p>football, commonly shortened as football and named soccer in some locations,[a] is a team sport played between two teams
        of 11 players who almost exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch.
        
        The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
        rectangular-framed goal defended by the opponent. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for
        a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it
        is the world's most popular sport.</p>

        <h1>Basketball</h1>
        <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams of five players each (excluding subs), opposing one another on a
        rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in
        diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.05 m) high to a
        backboard at each end of the court). Teams alternate between offense, when they attempt to score, and defense, when they
        try to prevent the opposing side from scoring. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point
        line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical
        foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if
        regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. However, if the
        additional period still results in a tied score, yet another additional period is mandated. This goes on until the score
        is not tied anymore.</p>
